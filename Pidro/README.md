This is a simple python script to control 2 DC motors using Raspberrypi and TB6612FNG motor controller

control:

UP(arrow key) = clockwise(2 motor)
DOWN(arrow key) = counter clockwise(2 motor)
LEFT(arrow key) = clockwise(left motor) + counter clockwise(right motor)
RIGHT(arrow key) = counter clockwise(left motor) +  clockwise(right motor)


Note: I use and modify some script from "RemoteKeyborgC" from PicoBorg
